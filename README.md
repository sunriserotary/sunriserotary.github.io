The source for the Sunrise Rotary website. This page is currently live and hosted through GitHub pages; go to [sunriserotary.github.io](sunriserotary.github.io) to see a demo!  

## Premise
This website was built with collaboration through the Santa Cruz Sunrise Rotary (SCSR) Club and a group of UC Santa Cruz students in CMPS 119, Software for Society. The hope is that the SCSR Club will use this website to heighten their online presence going forward.
